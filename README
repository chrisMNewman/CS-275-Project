index.html - mainpage that allows viewing of available threads

thread.html - view the posts in a particular thread, TODO implement database access to make this actually work

mikechrisforum.css - main stylesheet that should be made to work with all three pages


my current plan is to have a hader and footer that are mostly the same between the three page types -mike
