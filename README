identifier.php - required to make homepage links work and to specify database.  this file is not on GIT because we each have different databases and site addresses

thhis is my current identifier.php:
<?php 
$homepage = "http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fortnerm/CS-275-Project/";
$dbhost = 'oniddb.cws.oregonstate.edu';
$dbname = 'fortnerm-db';
$dbuser = 'fortnerm-db';
$dbpass = 'KubP1OidG5uYDuBX';
?>
