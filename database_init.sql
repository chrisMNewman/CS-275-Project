#To update any of the entities, make sure that any foreign keys point to existing primary keys of other entities. 
#All posts should point to a unique user ID and thread ID, and all threads should point to a unique user ID.
#When posts are deleted, the next post that is created will have the same post number as the most recently deleted post. 
#(For example, if post with post number 5 is deleted, the next post that is created will have post number 5). 
#If threads are to be deleted, all posts with foreign keys pointing to those respective threads should also be deleted.

#Because threads must be owned by users, users should not be deleted at this time. The forum can hold one million users, so this shouldnâ€™t be a problem.
